    <h1>GIS Portfolio</h1>
    <p>I'm a 3rd Year Student studying at the University of Auckland and majoring in Geographic Information Science (GIS). Below is a collection of GIS analysis i've completed in my assignments.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Folium Map Displaying Available Airbnbs in Portland, Oregon</h3>
    <p><iframe src="pdx1.html" width="800" height="400" resize="both"></iframe></p>
    <p>After sourcing airbnb data from <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html">insideairbnb</a>, I entered the data into PostGIS and performed an SQL query using PostgreSQL to create the map.</p>
    
    <br>
    <h3>Matplotlib Map of Significant Earthquakes (5.5 or Higher) from 1965 to 2016 - Point Size sorted by Earthquake Magnitude<sup>5<sup></h3>
    <img src="mgntd.png" width="800" height="400" class="image1">
    <p>Using Matplotlib, Python, and Earthquakes data sourced from Kaggle, I created a map displaying the global distribution of earthquakes. Magnitude values were increased by an exponential of 5 to emphasise the differences in earthquake size.</p>
    
    <br>
    <h3>Multi Criteria Evaluation (Completed in 2020)</h3>
    <img src="mce1.png" class="image1" width="600" height="450">
    <p>I performed a multi-criteria evaluation for the conflict between carpet and agriculture industries in Nepal. Variables including slope and proximity to infrastructure were implemented.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Map of the Bus Commuter Catchment for Mt. Eden Train Station, Auckland</h3>
    <img src="ntwrk1.png" class="image1" width="700" height="528">
    <p>I performed a network analysis to find the catchment where commuters who would walk and bus to the Mt. Eden Train Station likely would be located.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Map of the Bus Commuter Catchment for Mt. Eden Train Station, Auckland</h3>
    <img src="ntwrk2.png" class="image1" width="700" height="528">
    <p>I performed a network analysis to find the catchment where local commuters that would simply walk to Mt. Eden Train Station would be located.</p>
    
    <br>
    <h3>Supervised Classification of Toshka Lakes using <a href="https://code.earthengine.google.com">Google Earth Engine</a>  (Completed in 2020)</h3>
    <img src="gee-1.png" class="image1" width="600" height="450">
    <p>I trained the classification algorithm for three seperate land covers: Land (Desert), Water, and Agriculture.</p>
    
    <br>
    <h3>Supervised Classifications of Toshka Lakes from 2014, 2018, 2019, and 2020</h3>
    <img src="toshka1.png" class="image1" width="900" height="300">
    <p>This map shows supervised classifcations of the Toshka Lakes in Egypt from selected years using Land, Water, and Agriculture land covers.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Maps of Land Cover Change between Selected Years at Toshka Lakes</h3>
    <img src="toshka2.png" class="image1" width="700" height="290">
    <p>This map shows the how land covers at the Toshka Lakes have changed from 2014 to 2018, and 2019 to 2020.</p>
